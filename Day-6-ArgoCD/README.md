# Argo CD Complete Setup Guide 

# What is Argo CD?

Argo CD is a GitOps Continuous Delivery tool for Kubernetes.

It automatically deploys Kubernetes applications from a Git repository.

Argo CD continuously monitors:

* Kubernetes manifests
* Helm charts
* Kustomize files

and syncs them into a Kubernetes cluster.

---

# What is GitOps?

GitOps means:

* Git repository is the single source of truth
* All Kubernetes configurations are stored in Git
* Any changes pushed to Git are automatically deployed to Kubernetes

Benefits:

* Version control
* Easy rollback
* Automated deployments
* Infrastructure consistency
* Audit tracking

# Argo CD Architecture

## Main Components

### 1. API Server

Handles:

* UI
* CLI
* Authentication
* API requests

---

### 2. Repository Server

Responsible for:

* Cloning Git repositories
* Reading manifests
* Helm rendering
* Kustomize rendering

---

### 3. Application Controller

Responsible for:

* Monitoring applications
* Comparing desired state vs live state
* Synchronization
* Self-healing

---

# Argo CD Workflow

Developer Pushes Code â Git Repository â Argo CD Detects Changes â Syncs to Kubernetes Cluster

---

# Prerequisites

Before installing Argo CD:

You need:

* Kubernetes Cluster
* kubectl installed
* Argo CD CLI
* GitHub repository
* Internet access

Supported Kubernetes:

* EKS
* AKS
* GKE
* Minikube
* K3s
* Kind

---

# Step 1: Create Namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
```

---

# Step 2: Install Argo CD

```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

---

# Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
kubectl get pods -n argocd
```

All pods should be in Running state.

---

# Step 4: Expose Argo CD Server


## LoadBalancer

```bash
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

Get External IP:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n argocd
```

---

# Step 5: Get Initial Admin Password

```bash
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

Username:

```text
admin
```
---

# Step 7: Login to Argo CD

```bash
argocd login with loadbalncer url
```

Provide:

* Username
* Password

---

# Private Repository Integration

# Why Private Repo Authentication is Needed

Private repositories require authentication.

Without authentication:

* Argo CD cannot clone repository
* Manifests cannot be fetched
* Application deployment fails

---

# Authentication Methods

Argo CD supports:

1. HTTPS + Username/Token
2. SSH Authentication

---

# Method 1: HTTPS with Personal Access Token


# Method : SSH Authentication

# Why SSH?

SSH authentication is more secure.

Used mostly in:

* Production
* Enterprises
* Secure environments

---

# Step 1: Generate SSH Key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "argocd"
```

Files created:

```text
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

---

# Step 2: Add Public Key to GitHub

Open:

GitHub â Settings â SSH and GPG Keys

Add:

```text
id_rsa.pub
```
---

# Creating Argo CD Application

# What is an Application?

An Argo CD Application is:

* A deployment definition
* Connects Git repo to Kubernetes cluster
* Defines:

  * Source repository
  * Path
  * Destination cluster
  * Namespace

---


# Application Parameters Explanation

## --repo

Git repository URL.

---

## --path

Folder inside repository containing manifests.

Example:

```text
kubernetes/
manifests/
helm/
```

---

## --dest-server

Target Kubernetes cluster.

Default cluster:

```text
https://kubernetes.default.svc
```

---

## --dest-namespace

Namespace where application will deploy.

---

# Sync Application

```bash
argocd app sync ecommerce-app
```

This deploys manifests into Kubernetes.

---

# Auto Sync

# What is Auto Sync?

Automatically deploys changes whenever Git repository updates.

---

# Enable Auto Sync

---

# Self Healing

# What is Self Healing?

If someone manually changes Kubernetes resources:

Argo CD restores them back to Git state.

Enable:

---

# Pruning

# What is Pruning?

Deletes Kubernetes resources removed from Git.

Enable:

---

# Application Lifecycle

Git Push â Argo CD Detects Changes â Compare Desired vs Live State â Sync â Deployment

---

# Application States

## Synced

Git state matches cluster state.

---

## OutOfSync

Cluster differs from Git.

---

## Healthy

Application running successfully.

---

## Degraded

Application has issues.

Examples:

* CrashLoopBackOff
* Failed deployment
* Pod failures

---

# Deploy Using YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapp-argo-application
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default

  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/CloudTechDevOps/Kubernetes-0730.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: Day-5-Argocd
  destination: 
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: myapp

  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true

    automated:
      selfHeal: true
      prune: true
```

Apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f app.yaml
```
---

# Kustomize Integration

Argo CD supports Kustomize.

Repository structure:

```text
base/
overlays/
```

---

# Multi Cluster Deployment

Argo CD can deploy to multiple clusters.

Add cluster:

```bash
argocd cluster add CONTEXT_NAME
```

List clusters:

```bash
argocd cluster list
```

---

# Argo CD UI Overview

Main sections:

* Applications
* Repositories
* Clusters
* Settings
* Projects

---

# Summary

Argo CD is a Kubernetes GitOps deployment tool.

Workflow:

1. Store manifests in Git
2. Connect repository to Argo CD
3. Create application
4. Sync manifests
5. Argo CD deploys automatically
6. Git becomes source of truth

Private repositories can be integrated using:

* HTTPS tokens
* SSH keys
* Repository secrets

Argo CD continuously monitors Git and Kubernetes to maintain desired application state.
